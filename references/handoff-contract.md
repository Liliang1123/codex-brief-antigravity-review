# Handoff Contract

The Handoff Contract is the single machine-readable state shared by
`openspec-superpower-change` and `codex-brief-antigravity-review`. Schema version
3 applies only to Handoff-backed external execution; standalone and inline work
do not create this contract.

## Canonical Location

Keep exactly one mutable marker block in
`docs/agent-collab/<change-id>/status.md`. Brief, Report, Review, Gate, and chat
output must not embed another mutable block; they reference the canonical path,
revision, batch, attempt, and SHA-256 fingerprint.

## Required Fields And Values

Required fields include every field in the example.

- `lifecycle_state`: `ready-for-brief`, `ready-for-execution`,
  `ready-for-review`, `needs-fix`, `blocked`,
  `awaiting-final-verification`, or `complete`.
- `last_review_result`: `not-run`, `pass`, `fail`, or `blocked`.
- `final_verification` and `final_review_result`: `pending`, `pass`, `fail`,
  or `blocked`.
- `attempt` and `contract_revision`: positive integers; booleans are invalid.
- `next_owner`: `openspec-superpower-change`,
  `codex-brief-antigravity-review`, `external-agent`, or `user`.
- `step_critical`, `final_critical`, and `stop_conditions`: non-empty lists of
  non-blank strings for every evidence profile.
- `readonly_fields`: exactly the immutable field set shown above, without
  duplicates or additional mutable fields.

An artifact reference is either `null` or this mapping:

```yaml
path: docs/project-relative/evidence.md
sha256: 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```

Artifact paths must be project-relative, may not contain `..`, and must remain
inside the declared artifact root after symlink resolution. A non-pending result
requires a matching artifact reference; a pending/not-run result requires
`null`. Artifact paths are distinct by evidence role. The only allowed reuse is
one identical `timeout-audit` artifact serving as both the attempt Report and
the blocking Review.

Every referenced file contains exactly one immutable evidence manifest:

````markdown
<!-- COOP_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST_START -->
```yaml
evidence_schema_version: 1
evidence_role: batch-review
evidence_result: pass
change_id: add-example-change
current_batch: 1
attempt: 1
contract_revision: 3
canonical_sha256: 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```
<!-- COOP_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST_END -->
````

Valid roles are `attempt-report`, `batch-review`, `preflight-review`,
`timeout-audit`, `final-verification`, and `final-review`. Results are `pass`,
`fail`, or `blocked`. `current_batch` and `attempt` identify the work evidenced.
`contract_revision` and `canonical_sha256` identify the earlier canonical status
revision that the artifact reports on, reviews, or verifies; this source
fingerprint avoids a hash cycle with the new artifact reference.

Runtime status validation checks file existence, non-empty content, SHA-256,
role-to-state binding, result-to-status binding, batch/attempt freshness, source
revision ordering, canonical fingerprint format, and matching `change_id`; a
heading or filename alone is not evidence identity. `preflight-review` and
`timeout-audit` are BLOCKED-only batch evidence and never satisfy batch PASS.
Final completion validation additionally requires `--previous-status` so the
final Review manifest can be checked against the actual prior revision and its
SHA-256.

This is an external execution contract: `executor` is `external-agent`,
`governor` is `codex-brief-antigravity-review`, and mode is
`approved-implementation`, approved `self-evolution`, or `direct-change`.

## Lifecycle And Review Loop

```text
ready-for-brief -> ready-for-execution -> ready-for-review
batch FAIL -> needs-fix -> new attempt on the same batch
batch BLOCKED -> blocked -> new attempt on the same batch
PASS non-final -> next batch ready-for-brief
PASS final -> awaiting-final-verification (pending/pending)
final verification PASS -> awaiting-final-verification (pass/pending)
final Review PASS -> complete
final FAIL -> needs-fix; final BLOCKED -> blocked
```

Valid result tuples by state:

| State | `last_review_result` | `final_verification` | `final_review_result` |
|---|---|---|---|
| active attempt | `not-run` | `pending` | `pending` |
| `needs-fix` after batch Review | `fail` | `pending` | `pending` |
| `needs-fix` after final verification | `pass` | `fail` | `pending` |
| `needs-fix` after final Review | `pass` | `pass` | `fail` |
| `blocked` during batch | `blocked` | `pending` | `pending` |
| `blocked` during final verification | `pass` | `blocked` | `pending` |
| `blocked` during final Review | `pass` | `pass` | `blocked` |
| awaiting final verification | `pass` | `pending` or `pass` | `pending` |
| `complete` | `pass` | `pass` | `pass` |

Rules:

- Every state change increments `contract_revision` by one.
- `FAIL` and `BLOCKED` never advance `current_batch`.
- A batch retry increments `attempt`; attempt-specific artifacts never overwrite
  earlier evidence. Batch recovery may return to Brief or execution, never
  directly to Review without a fresh Report.
- Every `ready-for-review` decision preserves the exact Report reference it
  reviewed. Non-final promotion requires Review PASS plus a Review artifact;
  clearing or replacing either reference in that decision is invalid.
- `ready-for-review` requires `attempt_report_artifact`. A pre-dispatch
  `blocked` state may have no Report yet; its Preflight Review still supplies
  `last_review_artifact`. Any completed batch Review, timeout audit, or blocking
  Review requires `last_review_artifact`.
- Final batch PASS keeps `current_batch == planned_batches`, sets
  `awaiting-final-verification`, and returns ownership to the router.
- Final verification PASS is persisted in a new revision before final Review.
  Direct `pending/pending -> complete` is invalid.
- Final verification FAIL/BLOCKED may only start from `pass/pending/pending`;
  final Review PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED may only start from the separately persisted
  `pass/pass/pending` revision.
- A `blocked -> blocked` metadata update preserves batch, attempt, the complete
  result tuple, and every evidence reference. It cannot change gate stage.
- Recovery from a final-gate BLOCKED state also preserves the accepted attempt
  Report and batch Review references.
- Any implementation change after final verification invalidates that PASS and
  clears its artifact before the next execution attempt.
- `complete` requires attempt Report, batch Review, final verification, and final
  Review evidence; it is terminal.
- Missing, stale, duplicated, contradictory, unsafe, or unparsable state is
  `BLOCKED` and returns to the router or user.

## Ownership And Integrity

The router creates the contract, owns readonly routing fields and final gates,
and may mark `complete`. The brief governor updates batch lifecycle fields
according to valid transitions. External agents never edit canonical status.

After the governor writes `ready-for-execution`, it hashes the complete canonical
status file. Brief and Report record that same execution revision and SHA-256.
Before moving to `ready-for-review`, the governor recomputes the hash; mismatch is
`BLOCKED`. Review records from/to revision, from/to SHA-256, and transition
validation evidence.

Validate an already persisted non-complete snapshot structurally with:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_core_gates.py . \
  --status docs/agent-collab/<change-id>/status.md \
  --artifact-root .
```

Without `--previous-status`, `canonical_sha256` is format-checked but cannot be
matched to a prior file. Before applying any transition that introduces a new
artifact, write the proposed status to `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}`, keep the current
canonical status unchanged, and add:

```bash
--previous-status docs/agent-collab/<change-id>/status.md
```

This validates the transition and matches the new artifact's source revision
and SHA-256 to the actual prior canonical file. After PASS, atomically replace
the canonical status with the proposed file and preserve the command result as
evidence. Never persist the proposed or previous marker snapshot inside the
project; the project must still contain exactly one Handoff marker block.

`complete` mechanically requires this previous-status check. The validator
rejects a complete single snapshot because it cannot prove the sequential final
transition. Keep any temporary previous/proposed snapshot outside the project
only until closure validation finishes, then delete it.

### Trust Boundary

`--previous-status` proves one transition against the current canonical file; it
does not independently reconstruct or cryptographically authenticate every
earlier revision. This workflow trusts that the governor has not rewritten the
current canonical prior state and that each earlier transition PASS output is
retained in repository evidence/history. A hostile actor able to forge the
prior state and all artifacts is outside this lightweight validator's threat
model; append-only journals or signatures would be a separate, heavier design.

## Migration From Schema 2

Do not mutate a schema-2 contract in place while execution is active. Stop the
batch, preserve its attempt artifacts, create the four schema-3 artifact fields,
replace string `none` blocker values with YAML `null` where applicable, validate
the migrated snapshot, and resume with a fresh attempt.
